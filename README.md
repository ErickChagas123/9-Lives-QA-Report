# QA - 9 Lives

## Bugs
Each bug found is documented in the 'assets/bugs/' folder:
- 'bug-XXX-<title>.md' → bug description
- 'bug-XXX-checklist.md' → QA checklist for testing the bug
- Evidence (screenshots, videos) → attached in the same folder

## Templates
Templates for future bugs are stored in 'assets/templates/':
- bug-report-template.md → template to report new bugs
- bug-checklist-template.md → template to create QA checklists

## How to test
- Follow the checklist of each bug before marking it as resolved.
- Update the '.md' file if new evidence is available.
